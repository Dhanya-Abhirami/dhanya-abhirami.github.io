      <description>The beauty of a garden lies in the varieties of flowers it holds. No one would like a garden if it has a single type of flower. It is nature’s dictum that all different things should co-exist together. Similarly, the beauty of our world lies in the diversity of people with their cultures interwoven.
India is multi-cultural multi-lingual country since ages. With its different facets in every turn – be it religion, language, race, castes, it presents a different beautiful picture.</description>

      <title>How &#39;MAKE IN INDIA&#39; can succeed ?</title>

      <description>Make In India is an initiative launched by our Government to encourage multi-national, as well as national companies to manufacture their products in India. The objective of this initiative is to transform India into a global design and manufacturing hub.
Our country has 16% of world population. So, in pure technical sense, one in six objects produced anywhere in the world should find its market in India. If we become self-reliant in our requirements, the precious foreign exchange will not go out of our country.</description>
