      <title>The importance of education in National Integration</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The beauty of a garden lies in the varieties of flowers it holds. No one would like a garden if it has a single type of flower. It is nature’s dictum that all different things should co-exist together. Similarly, the beauty of our world lies in the diversity of people with their cultures interwoven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India is multi-cultural multi-lingual country since ages. With its different facets in every turn – be it religion, language, race, castes, it presents a different beautiful picture. Diversity is one thing we all have in common. In spite of having such diverse dimensions, one thing we have in common is our affinity to Mother land – India. On Mother India, Mahakavi Subramanya Bharati said, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ival Seppu Mozhi Pathinettudayaal, enir sinthanai ondrudayal&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;, - which roughly translates as &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mother India speaks different languages, but her thought is unified and towards a common goal&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. That was the confidence and superiority complex Bharati had a century ago, when the education levels were in pathetic condition and British controlling almost whole of India. Today, after 7 decades of independence, we are definitely far better. However, to develop and make our country a leader in the world, we need to take all our people together. To nurture and develop the spirit of national integration, education acts as a catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How &#39;MAKE IN INDIA&#39; can succeed ?</title>
      <link>https://dhanya-abhirami.github.io/posts/make-in-india/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Make In India is an initiative launched by our Government to encourage multi-national, as well as national companies to manufacture their products in India. The objective of this initiative is to transform India into a global design and manufacturing hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our country has 16% of world population. So, in pure technical sense, one in six objects produced anywhere in the world should find its market in India.  If we become self-reliant in our requirements, the precious foreign exchange will not go out of our country. For achieving this, we need to focus on areas like quality, reliability, variety, affordability, which are vital for any product to survive the cut-throat competition posed by mighty giants from abroad. We should achieve international standards in all these aspects. In today’s world, survival holds the key to success.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
